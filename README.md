### customer segmentation using Kmeans

Task
Your task is to perform customer segmentation using KMeans. We are interested in grouping our customers into groups based on similar characteristics. This can help the company effectively allocate marketing resources. We will use customer age, education, years of employment, income, debt, whether they defaulted, and their debt-to-income ratio to group them into segments.
You can download the data here. The original data is from this data source.
- Use KMeans to create various customer segments.
1. Use an Elbow Plot of inertia.
2. And a plot of Silhouette Scores.
3. Choose a K based on the results.

- Analyze the clusters you made in Part 1.
1. Create analytical visualizations that explore statistics for each feature for each cluster.
2. Write a description of each cluster based on the visualizations you created.
1. Do more than describe the numbers; try to see beyond the numbers and describe the people represented by each cluster.
2. Include at least one insight for each cluster.
3. Create one or two recommendations for your stakeholders (the credit card company) regarding how they should market credit cards differently or which cards they should market to each cluster based on your data and insights.
